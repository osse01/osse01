BSc in Electrical Engineering and (soon) also in Applied Mathematics.
Studying for a MSc in Applied Mathematics at Lik√∂ping University.

Know C/C++ and Python at an intermediate level.

My biggest interests are in maths, which is why many projects are optimization problems 
written in the Julia programming language, often solved using the HiGHS solver.

My BSc in Electrical Engineering was a autonomous small RC-car, built from scrath.
The code for the control systems, sensors and communication was done ourselfs. 
I mainly focused on the code for estimating the position from LiDAR-data but also pathplanning when the obstacles had been localized.

My BSc in Applied Mathematics studied a variant of cubic B-splines called Lavery splines in both one and two variables. 
The idea is to minimize the "total curvature" by minimizing the norm of the second derivative. 
It turns out that if you make the first derivatives "free", and then minimize the norm of the second derivative, you get a graph/surface with minimal "unnecessary" oscillations.
