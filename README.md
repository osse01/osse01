BSc in Electrical Engineering and in Applied Mathematics.
Studying for a MSc in Applied Mathematics at Lik√∂ping University.

Know C/C++ and Python at an intermediate level.

The BSc in Electrical Engineering was a group project involving an autonomous small RC-car, built from scratch.
The code for the control systems, sensors and communication was done ourselves. 
I mainly focused on the code for estimating the position from LiDAR-data but also pathplanning when the obstacles had been localized.

The BSc in Applied Mathematics was about a variant of cubic B-splines called Lavery splines, both in one and two variables. 
The idea is to minimize the "total curvature" by minimizing the norm of the second derivative. 
It turns out that if you make the first derivatives "free", and then minimize the norm of the second derivative, you get a graph/surface with minimal "unnecessary" oscillations.
