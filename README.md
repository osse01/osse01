Hi, I am Oscar

I know C++ and Python at an intermediate level.
I have also studied courses in Assembly (ARM architecture) and computer structures.

My biggest interests are in maths, which is why many projects are optimization problems 
written in the Julia programming language, often solved using the HiGHS solver.
